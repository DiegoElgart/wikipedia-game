A game project by @msemrik and @DiegoElgart



### First time running in this repo? Don't worry, follow these steps:

#### SERVER
1. move to "server" folder: `cd server`
2. Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project (convert ts into js, run code cleaning tools): `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

You can check if it's working heading to http://localhost:4000 in your browser.

You want to try a little bit harder? Try reaching following endpoint:
http://localhost:4000/game/start

Even more hard? Try sending language field in the body.
